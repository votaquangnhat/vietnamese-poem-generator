# Vietnamese poem generator

This repository contains the implementation of a Vietnamese poem generator, developed as part of the Project 1 course at SOICT.

The model is fine-tuned from [NlpHUST/gpt2-vietnamese](https://huggingface.co/NlpHUST/gpt2-vietnamese) using the [Vietnamese Poetry Corpus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/phamson02/vietnamese-poetry-corpus), focusing exclusively on the "lục bát" genre.
